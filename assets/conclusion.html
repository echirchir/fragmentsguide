<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Below are the steps followed when communicating between fragments and activities:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create Your Main Activity</li>
    <li>Create Your Fragment(s)</li>
    <li>Create Your Interface with method(s)</li>
    <li>Implement Your Interface in Your Activity</li>
    <li>Override Your Interface's method in your Activity</li>
    <li>In One of your fragments, create an instance of your interface by casting your activity to it; inside onAttach()</li>
    <li>When ready to notify the activity, call the interface method passing the required arguments.</li>
    <li>Inside your activity, find your next fragment using the fragment manager.</li>
    <li>If your second fragment does not have a method, create one.</li>
    <li>Inside your activity, in the interface method you overrode, call the second fragment's method to notify it of changes</li>
    <li>In fragment two's method, make the changes that the user expected to see.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <span style="color: blue">Summary</span>, using an interface to facilitate communication between fragments and activities reduces coupling of classes. That means
classes know very little to nothing about others. You can then use your fragments anywhere you want without having to change anything anywhere else.</p>

<p><i>I hope this app helped you learn about fragments and how to communicate between them through the communicator design pattern without directly talking to each other.</i></p>
