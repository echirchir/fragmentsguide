<h2 style="text-align: center">What Is a Fragment?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    A <span style="color: blue">Fragment</span> is a piece of an application's user interface or behavior that can be placed in an Activity.<br /><br />
    Interaction with fragments is done through <span style="color: blue">FragmentManager</span>,
    which can be obtained via <span style="color: blue">Activity.getFragmentManager()</span> and <span style="color: blue">Fragment.getFragmentManager()</span>.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This app will show you how to communicate between fragments and activities in your application.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Using the communicator design pattern, we develop classes that know little to nothing about one another. In object oriented paradigm,
it is referred to as loose coupling. You always want to eliminate or reduce how much information one class knows about another. That also reduces dependency respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">You can easily find more information on Android Fragments online once you are done reading the content of this app.</p>
